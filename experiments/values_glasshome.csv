"Togetherness","Togetherness: This is our commitment to building deep human connection—from our team, out to the wider world. This means to foster environments of trust where we as humans can be our true, unmasked selves, embracing vulnerability and support each other's growth. This guides us as we co-create with the neighbourhoods that we serve, ensuring that we listen, understand, we give and receive feedback, so we enable creations with positive and shared impact. Ultimately, our vision is a world with less loneliness and more authentic connections that allows us all to stand together, hold each other's backs and evolve as humans."
"Genuine Individuality","Genuine Individuality: We are empowering ourselves and others to be authentically unique. We believe in cultivating safe spaces where each person can explore their own path and share their unique strengths, trusting that they will be supported. This goes both for us internally as a team and for the neighborhoods that we build. In the end, it’s our vision for a world where every human can be seen for who they truly are, finding strength in their own identity and enabling others to do the same."
"Serve humanity","Serve Humanity: Loneliness, stress and planetary exploitation is results of the modern society and is burning in the core of our why. We ask our selves and every individual that cross our path what we all are truly longing for. It is our belief that all of us as individuals need to start by giving ourselves what we truly want in order to authentically (and abundantly) be able to serve others. And this is the foundation of Glasshome: to empower individuals to find their true longing and use it to build a better future for us all. We are looking beyond the obvious and are dedicating ourselves to find solutions that not only benefit this generation but also have a lasting, positive impact on the future of humanity."
"Well being","Well being: For us this means to give ourselves and each other the right conditions to live a long, happy and healthy life. This means prioritizing what is often overlooked in today's fast-paced world, such as regular movement, healthy eating and stress reduction. We believe in creating a sense of belonging and building strong social circles that support positive behaviours. By prioritizing purpose, loved ones, and multigenerational support, we aim to inspire a world where everyone can thrive and live a full, balanced life. When we, as individuals create the right conditions for ourselves and for others, we believe it will ultimately lead to a healthier planet."
"Everyone is a designer","Everyone is a designer: When we act from a place of true connection and authenticity, we can easily access our inner creativity and playfulness, reconnecting with the child thats live within all of us. As a team, we enable each other to put our unique thoughts into form. For the neighborhoods we build, this means providing spaces where people can connect, dream and create their dream lives. It's through the creative process, a critical eye and the freedom to iterate that we in the end build true quality. Ultimately, we believe that when we empower everyone to be a creator - we build a better future, enabling a world where we all thrive together."
