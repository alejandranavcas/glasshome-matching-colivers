       "\t\t\tIn the last week or so, in several different contexts, I have found myself pontificating on human values and the part they play in philosophy and human life. For me, the subject always comes forward when there is a discussion of objectivity - objective truth, objective morals, objective beauty. I believe the idea of objectivity can be useful in a relatively limited set of circumstances as long as it is recognized that applying it outside it's limits will lead to misunderstanding and confusion. I think that's true because talk of objectivity obscures the extent to which human value directs our thoughts, feelings, and decisions.<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<u><b>That's all well and good, and I'd like to discuss that further, but not in this thread.</b></u> I bolded and underlined the previous sentence so that, if there are discussions later about whether or not a particular comment is consistent with the original post, it will be clear. What I would like to discuss is what our specific values are. In this thread, I'd like the \"our\" to mean us, the denizens of the forum. Does that mean Western Civilization? I'll leave that open.<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "So, anyway. What are values? From the web:<br/>\n",

       "<li>The principles that help you to decide what is right and wrong, and how to act in various situations.</li>\n",

       "In my understanding, evaluative aspects, and thus values, are central to more than just the listed areas.
